# ⚙️ Configuración

## Filters

- **Search files** lets you filter notes based on a search query. To learn about how you can write more advanced search queries, refer to [[Search]].
- **Tags** toggles whether to show tags in the graph.
- **Attachments** toggles whether to show attachments in the graph.
- **Existing files only** toggles whether to show notes that exists in your vault. Since a note doesn't need to exist to link to it, this can help reduce limit your graph to notes that you actually have in your vault.
- **Orphans** toggles whether to show notes without any links

## Groups

> [!tip] Create groups of notes to distinguish them from each other using color.

## Display

- **Arrows** toggles whether to show the direction of each link.
- **Text fade threshold** controls the text transparency for the name of each note.
- **Node size** controls the size of the circle representing each note.
- **Link thickness** controls the line width for each link.

## Forces

- **Center Forces:** controls how compact the graph is. A higher value creates a more circular graph.
- **Repel force** controls how much a node pushes other nodes away from it.
- **Link force** controls the pull on each link. If the link was a rubber band, the link force controls how tight or loose the band is.
- **Link distance** controls the length of the lines between each note.
